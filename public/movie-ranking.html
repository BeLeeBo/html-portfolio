<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>Matrix is one of those MASTERPIECES that can blow your mind.<br />
</p>

<h3>The Good The Bad and The Ungly</h3>
<p>My favorite Western Movie with one of my favorite actors , Clint Eastwood <br />
</p>

<h3>F.R.I.E.N.D.S</h3>
<p>Although not a movie , its a top tier series I like watching everyday in my free time<br />
Its comedy series about 6 friends , 3 women and 3 guys interacting with each other having good laughs.</p>
